# Data Science <hr>

In a mission to convert Non-Data Scientists (Aspiring Data Scientists) to Data-Scientists, Facebook Developer Circle Hyderabad has started Data Science series.
By encouraging peer learning, we have asked them to form teams.
This is a 3-month biweekly program with 10+ Industry mentors coming down to help the attendees.
We encourage online study groups. We will be updating this repository with the data science topics regularly.
